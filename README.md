# OBS Scripts Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository for OBS scripts! Here, I'll be sharing various scripts I write to enhance your Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) experience.

## Current Scripts

### 1. Auto-Resize (Version 1.1.0)
Automatically resize any windows that don't fit within the scene. This script helps maintain a clean and organized layout during your broadcasts.

### 2. Auto-Recapture (Work in Progress)
Automatically captures the topmost screen (of a window source) if it's not already selected. This script is currently a work in progress, but stay tuned for updates!

## More to Come
I'm continuously working on new scripts to improve OBS functionality. Keep an eye on this repository for future updates and additions.

Feel free to explore the scripts, contribute, or provide feedback. Happy streaming!
